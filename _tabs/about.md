## ⧉ Serein Lab
Founded in 2025, **Serein Lab** is an independent creative studio and R&D workshop that specializes in developing thoughtful, small-scale digital products and immersive educational content. At the intersection of creativity, software, and cognitive exploration, we design with the intent to foster curiosity, spark creativity, and engage minds in meaningful ways.

At Serein Lab, we believe in creating depth over scale. Our projects blend precision with playfulness, utility with beauty, and personal insight with public contribution. We aim to inspire a sense of calm and curiosity through every interaction, offering tools that nourish the mind and creative spirit.

## ⧉ Our Mission
Our mission is simple: to create digital products that make a lasting impact. These products are designed to support:

- **Creative focus and organization**: Helping individuals think and work more efficiently.
- **Cognitive growth through play and logic**: Offering games and tools that challenge and inspire.
- **Long-form learning and scientific exploration**: Providing resources for in-depth, purposeful study and discovery.

## ⧉ Studio Values
At Serein Lab, our core values guide every project we undertake:

- **Quality over scale**: We prioritize deep, thoughtful work that adds value over mass production.
- **Design with feeling**: Our software is built to be human, warm, and intentional—designed with care, not just code.
- **Play is serious**: We believe in the power of strategic games and toys to stimulate insight, discipline, and fun.
- **Transparent growth**: We build openly, documenting our journey and inviting others to learn, collaborate, and grow with us.

## ⧉ Project Philosophy
The projects at Serein Lab are divided into three key categories:

1. **Tools for Thinking**
   - Digital tools designed to enhance writing, planning, reflection, and focus.
   - **Examples**: Pebble, Bullet Journal App

2. **Games for the Mind**
   - Strategic or logic-based games that challenge, relax, or train the brain.
   - **Examples**: Brainiac, Cerebrawl

3. **Learning by Making**
   - Public projects that document personal research, creative processes, and prototypes.
   - **Examples**: Version 0.1, Everend prototyping, AI experiments

Each project we create is held to the following standards:
- **Intellectually honest**: We aim to create products that are meaningful and true to their purpose.
- **Emotionally resonant**: Our work should connect with the human experience and evoke thoughtful responses.
- **Technically feasible**: As a solo developer, we focus on projects that are ambitious yet achievable.
