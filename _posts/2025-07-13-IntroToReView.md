### ❏ Academic Re-exploration

➢➣ **Project Purpose**  
Re:View is an archival effort to revisit past university courses, reconstruct understanding, and produce clean, structured notes. It acts as an internal knowledge base and a practice in intellectual maintenance.

➢➣ **Structure**  
- Markdown notes organized by course and topic  
- Tags for misconceptions, insight, and pitfalls  
- Organized into *Modules* (e.g., `Operating_Systems`, `Machine_Learning`)  

➢➣ **2025–2026 Goals**  
- Complete 10+ full course reviews  
- Maintain a GitHub log of commits and progress  
- *Optional*: Publish selected modules as open educational resources
