# Hello, world

and welcome to the very first post from **Version 0.1**, a digital lab journal published by [Serein Lab](https://sereinlab.com).

Serein Lab officially opens its doors today, and this space marks the beginning of a long-term creative and research journey. Version 0.1 will be home to essays, learning logs, design experiments, and thinking tools—all shared openly as part of a transparent, evolving studio practice.

## Why Version 0.1?

In software, version 0.1 often marks the first working prototype. It's rough, real, and full of intention. This publication follows that spirit: imperfect by design, but carefully built to learn in public, grow with purpose, and reflect honestly.

## What You’ll Find Here

Version 0.1 is organized around four evolving themes:

- **Re:Search** – Long-form essays and research notes on creativity, cognition, and software.
- **Re:View** – Course reflections, conceptual summaries, and technical study notes.
- **Re:prendre** – A journal of learning French, and thoughts on language acquisition.
- **Re:boot** – Software engineering prep and coding practice, framed as a system of thinking.

## An Invitation

If you're someone who enjoys thoughtful tools, playful logic, and creative learning—you're in the right place. This studio exists to make useful things slowly, and to share the process as it unfolds.

Thanks for stopping by. Here's to v0.1—and everything that comes after.
